   - Then focus on execution engine for reliability
   - Next implement backtesting to validate strategies

2. **Implement incrementally**:
   - Add one feature at a time to each module
   - Test thoroughly before proceeding
   - Integrate with existing codebase gradually

3. **Use parallel development**:
   - Create new modules alongside existing ones
   - Test in sandbox environment
   - Switch to new implementation once stable

4. **Focus on data quality**:
   - Ensure reliable market data sources
   - Implement robust error handling
   - Add data validation throughout

These structured prompts should provide your IDE's AI assistant with detailed guidance for implementing each component of an advanced trading system.
For each module, focus on robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and optimization for the Solana blockchain and Jupiter protocol.
